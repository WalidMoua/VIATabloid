1. **Frontend**: Developed using React and TypeScript, the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the sensational stories. It supports features such as adding, reading, updating, and deleting stories.

2. **Backend**: The backend is powered by either Java Spring Boot or C# .NET, providing the necessary logic and APIs to manage the stories and communicate with the database.
